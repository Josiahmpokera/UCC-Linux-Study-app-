  "Linus Torvalds invented Linux itself. In 1991, Torvalds was a student at the University of Helsinki in Finland where he had been using Minix, a non-free Unix-like system, and began writing his own kernel.

Startups and smaller businesses often choose the open-source OS for their operating servers because so many distributions are freely available. ",
